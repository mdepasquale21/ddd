# Domain-Driven Design Boot Camp

The term domain-driven design (DDD) was coined by Eric Evans in his seminal book, Domain-Driven Design: Tackling
Complexity in the Heart of Software, written in 2003, and was well ahead of its time. DDD is an extremely useful tool
for designing scalable systems and platforms as well as the basis for designing better microservices architecture. On
the data side, DDD is useful for building distributed data architectures including data mesh.
